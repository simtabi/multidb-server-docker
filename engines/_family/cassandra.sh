#
# Cassandra differs from every other engine here in a way worth stating: it has
# no logical dump tool comparable to pg_dump. The production path is
# `nodetool snapshot`, which is a per-node hard-linked copy of the SSTables and
# restores only into a cluster of the same topology.
#
# For a toolkit whose promise is a VERIFIED restore, that is the wrong shape,
# so the dump here is logical: the schema via DESCRIBE plus the data via
# COPY TO. It restores anywhere, into any topology, and can be checked by
# counting rows -- which is what makes `make verify-backups` mean something.
# Snapshots remain the right answer for large production clusters and are
# documented as such rather than pretended away.
