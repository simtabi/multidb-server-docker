# Getting started

From a fresh clone to an application talking to a database, in about a minute.

Assumes [installation](installation.md) is done and `make verify-structure`
passes.

## 1. Start what you need

```bash
make up PROFILES=pg,ui
```

Profiles are opt-in, one per engine, so a laptop is never running six databases
to serve one project. Available: `pg`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `mongodb`,
`cassandra`, `ferretdb`, plus `ui`, `pooler`, `backup`, `metrics` and `prod`.

```bash
make status
```

## 2. Provision a project

```bash
make new-project NAME=myapp
```

That one command creates the database, an owner role with least privilege, a
read-only companion role, the configured extensions, and prints a paste-ready
connection block:

```
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=pg
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=myapp
DB_USERNAME=myapp_user
DB_PASSWORD=$(cat secrets/pg_myapp_user_password.txt)
```

The real block prints the password itself. It is generated, written to
`secrets/`, and never committed — the secret scan fails the build on a literal
credential in any tracked file, including this page, which is why the line above
is shown as a file read.

`DB_HOST` is the service name because your application container joins the
toolkit network. From the host it is `127.0.0.1`.

For another engine — all six work the same way:

```bash
make new-project NAME=myapp ENGINE=mysql
make new-project NAME=myapp ENGINE=mongodb
make new-project NAME=myapp ENGINE=cassandra
```

The owner role and the read-only role get **different** passwords, both written
to `secrets/`. They are separate principals, and sharing one credential would
mean a leak of the read-only role is a leak of the writable one.

## 3. Connect

A shell, without needing a client installed on your machine:

```bash
make psql                    # as the superuser
make psql USER_NAME=myapp    # as the project role
make mysql
make mariadb
```

These connect over the unix socket rather than TCP — faster, and it removes a
network surface entirely.

Or point any GUI at `127.0.0.1` on the engine's port. Ports bind to loopback
only by default, which is deliberate: an engine that is reachable from the
network the moment it starts is how development databases end up on the
internet.

The browser UIs are on <http://localhost:8080> under the `ui` profile — Adminer
for the SQL engines, plus per-engine consoles.

## 4. Isolation is real, and worth confirming

Roles cannot reach each other's databases. That is not a convention here, it is
enforced and tested — `myapp` connecting to `otherapp` is refused. If you have
two projects, try it; the harness does.

## 5. Back up before you need to

```bash
make backup ENGINE=pg DB=myapp     # one database
make backup-all                    # every database on every running engine
make verify-backups                # restore them into throwaway containers
```

`verify-backups` is the one that matters. It restores the latest dumps into
disposable containers and asserts the row counts came back, because a backup
nobody has restored is a hypothesis. Run it before you rely on the backups, not
after you need them.
