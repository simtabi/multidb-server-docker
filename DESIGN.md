# multidb-server design

Step 1 output: research resolved, versions pinned, spec reconciled. **No implementation code exists yet and none will be written until this document is approved.**

Everything below was verified during this session against live registries, the GitHub API, and — where prose was ambiguous or absent — against containers actually booted on arm64. Where a claim came from a doc page rather than an executed check, it says so.

## 1. Settled identity

## 4. PG extension matrix — arm64 ground truth

Verified by booting `pgvector/pgvector:0.8.6-pg17` **on arm64** and querying PGDG apt directly, not by reading availability pages.

| Extension | arm64 source | Version | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| vector | PGDG `postgresql-17-pgvector` | 0.8.6 | apt |
| postgis (+topology, raster) | PGDG `postgresql-17-postgis-3` | 3.6.4 | apt |
| pg_cron | PGDG `postgresql-17-cron` | 1.6.7 | apt |
| pgaudit | PGDG `postgresql-17-pgaudit` | 17.1 | apt |
| pg_repack | PGDG `postgresql-17-repack` | 1.5.3 | apt |
| pg_partman | PGDG `postgresql-17-partman` | 5.5.0 | apt — **spec's arm64 concern was misplaced** |
| pgtap | PGDG `postgresql-17-pgtap` | 1.3.4 | apt |
| http | PGDG `postgresql-17-http` | 1.7.2 | apt — **also fine on arm64** |
| hypopg | PGDG `postgresql-17-hypopg` | 1.4.3 | apt (bonus) |
| plpython3u | PGDG `postgresql-plpython3-17` | 17.10 | apt, behind `MDB_PG_PLPYTHON` |
| pg_stat_statements, pg_trgm, uuid-ossp, pgcrypto, citext, hstore | base image contrib | — | already present |
| **pg_graphql** | official `.deb`, **pg14–18 × amd64+arm64** | 1.6.1 | download release asset |
| **pg_net** | source build (C + libcurl) | 0.20.5 | builder stage |
| **pgsodium** | source build (C + libsodium) | 3.1.11 | builder stage |
| **pgjwt** | vendored SQL (pure plpgsql) | unversioned | see **D-06** |

**There is no extension in section 5 that cannot ship on arm64.** The honest answer to the named unknown is that the gap does not exist; four extensions simply need a non-apt path, and all four are architecture-portable. `pg_graphql` — the one most likely to have been a real problem, being Rust/pgrx — publishes prebuilt arm64 `.deb`s covering our entire 15–18 matrix.

## 5. Capacity truth table

Reproduced from SPEC.md section 21.1 as the sizing contract:

| Tier | MDB_MEM | shared_buffers | max_connections | RAM on connections | pgBouncer pool | App connections |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dev-small | 2 GB | 512 MB | 100 | ~1.0 GB | direct | 100 |
| prod-small | 4 GB | 1 GB | 100 | ~1.0 GB | 25 | ~1000 |
| prod-medium | 8 GB | 2 GB | 200 | ~2.0 GB | 50 | ~2500 |
| prod-large | 16 GB | 4 GB | 300 | ~3.0 GB | 100 | ~5000 |
| anti-pattern | any | any | 500 direct | ~5.0 GB idle | none | thrashing |

~10 MB per direct PG connection. Pooling is **required** under `prod`, enforced by `check-env`.

## 7. Decision log

Every spec issue found, and how it was resolved. Entries marked **[needs your call]** are the ones worth your attention.

**D-01 — SPEC.md had no section 21.** The kickoff prompt required reconciling "section 21 (scale, HA, sync)" and producing its capacity truth table; the design doc ended at section 20. *Resolution:* authored section 21 from the verified HA research baseline and appended it to SPEC.md as an approved amendment (you approved this before I wrote it). Its requirements are folded into services, env, commands, CI, and acceptance above.

**D-02 — Three-way identity conflict.** SPEC line 5 says "repo laranail/multidb-server"; section 16 publishes to `ghcr.io/simtabi/`; the actual checkout is `simtabi/multidb-server`. *Resolution:* `simtabi/multidb-server` + `ghcr.io/simtabi/*`, per your call.

**D-03 — The backup sidecar moved namespace and the spec's reference is stale.** `tiredofit/docker-db-backup` is now published as **`nfrastack/db-backup`**. `tiredofit/db-backup` last published `4.1.100` on 2026-03-13; `nfrastack/db-backup` is at `4.9.0` (2026-07-30). *Resolution:* pin `nfrastack/db-backup:4.9.0` by digest; SPEC references updated in docs during phase 4.

**D-04 — [needs your call] The free tier caps backup jobs at 3, which is exactly our engine count.** The project moved to a sponsorware model: "*To unlock advanced features, one must provide a code…*" and "*A limit of 3 can be created when not in advanced mode.*" I verified by parsing every table in the README that **no environment variable is actually `Adv.`-gated** — S3, encryption, checksums, `EXTRA_BACKUP_OPTS` and `BACKUP_GLOBALS` are all free. The only real constraint is the **3-job ceiling**, and pg + mysql + mariadb is exactly 3, leaving zero headroom for a fourth job (a second PG major during a migration window, or an HA replica). *Resolution offered, your pick:*
  - **(a) Recommended — write our own sidecar.** SPEC section 11 already mandates "one dump helper, two callers", and section 6.1 already bakes `rclone` and `zstd` into every engine image. A thin cron container on `multidb-server-cli` driving that same script removes a third-party dependency, the sponsorware risk, and the job ceiling, at the cost of writing retention/notification logic ourselves (~150 lines).
  - **(b) Keep `nfrastack/db-backup:4.9.0`** and accept a hard 3-job ceiling, documenting that a 4th engine or migration-window job requires a sponsor code.
  I will implement (a) unless you say otherwise, and either way the shared dump helper is the single source of dump flags.

**D-05 — Floating tags on the backup image are currently arm64-only.** `nfrastack/db-backup:latest` and `:alpine_3.24` publish **only** `linux/arm64` right now; the versioned `4.9.0` and `4.9.0-alpine_3.24` are correctly amd64+arm64. An amd64 CI runner pulling `latest` would fail outright. *Resolution:* no change needed — CLAUDE.md's "pinned digests everywhere, no `latest`" rule already prevents this. Recorded because it is a live demonstration that the rule earns its keep.

**D-06 — [needs your call] pgjwt is unmaintained.** `michelp/pgjwt` has **no releases at all** and its last push was **2023-03-02**, over three years ago. It is not in PGDG. It is ~50 lines of plpgsql over `pgcrypto`. *Resolution offered:* vendor the SQL into `images/pg/initdb.d/` pinned to a specific commit, documented as vendored-and-frozen; or drop it from the default suite. I lean **vendor**, because it is trivial, arch-independent, and dropping it silently changes the spec's promised extension list. Say the word if you would rather drop it.

**D-07 — Four extensions are not in PGDG; none is an arm64 blocker.** `pg_graphql`, `pg_net`, `pgsodium`, `pgjwt`. *Resolution:* `pg_graphql` 1.6.1 publishes official prebuilt `.deb`s for **pg14–18 on both amd64 and arm64** — download, no build. `pg_net` 0.20.5 and `pgsodium` 3.1.11 build from source in a builder stage (both C, both portable). `pgjwt` per D-06.

**D-08 — The spec's arm64 worry was aimed at the wrong extensions.** It named `http` and `pg_partman` as at-risk. Both are in PGDG for arm64 (`1.7.2` and `5.5.0`, verified on a booted arm64 container). No workaround needed.

**D-09 — PostgreSQL will shut down uncleanly under s6 unless we override the stop signal.** The official postgres image sets `STOPSIGNAL SIGINT` (fast shutdown). s6 sends **SIGTERM**, which PostgreSQL interprets as *smart* shutdown — it waits for every client to disconnect voluntarily, so it hangs until `S6_KILL_GRACETIME` expires and then takes SIGKILL, forcing crash recovery on the next boot. This is silent: the container appears to stop normally. *Resolution:* the PG s6 service directory gets a **`down-signal`** file containing `SIGINT` (confirmed supported in the s6 service directory format, replacing SIGTERM for `s6-svc -d`). `make verify` gets a dedicated clean-shutdown check that asserts the next boot logs no recovery.

**D-10 — The official pgBouncer image is amd64-only and years stale.** `pgbouncer/pgbouncer:latest` is a single-arch (amd64) manifest at version **1.15.0**, while upstream pgBouncer is at **1.25.2**. It would break the arm64 half of the matrix and ship a very old pooler. *Resolution:* use **`edoburu/pgbouncer:v1.25.2-p0`** (multi-arch amd64+arm64, current upstream version).

**D-11 — Patroni publishes no production image.** The Patroni project ships only a Dockerfile and compose explicitly marked development-only. Spilo (`ghcr.io/zalando/spilo-NN`) is multi-arch and production-grade, **but it bundles its own PostgreSQL**, which would replace `multidb-server-pg` entirely and discard our extension suite, baked config, and certs — directly contradicting the spec's core premise. *Resolution:* layer **Patroni 4.1.4 (pip)** onto our own `multidb-server-pg` image as an s6 service, gated by the `ha` profile. Keeps one PG image across dev, prod, and HA. Costs us the Patroni bootstrap wiring that Spilo would have given free; that work lands in phase 7.

**D-12 — etcd pinned at `v3.6.6`**, multi-arch confirmed. Section 21 states the 3-node minimum explicitly, because a 2-node etcd has *lower* availability than a single node.

**D-13 — MariaDB 11.4 auto-TLS does not conflict with our CA (verified empirically).** I booted `mariadb:11.4.12` twice. With no certs configured: `have_ssl=YES`, `ssl_ca`/`ssl_cert`/`ssl_key` all **empty**, and **no `.pem` written to the datadir** — so zero-config SSL uses an **ephemeral, in-memory, per-start** certificate. With our CA-issued certs in `/etc/mysql/conf.d`: our paths are honoured exactly and `require_secure_transport=ON` works. *Resolution:* explicit certs take precedence; auto-generation only fills a gap. Documented consequence: clients **cannot** use verify-full against the ephemeral cert (it changes every restart), which is precisely why `make certs` and the mounted CA are mandatory rather than optional.

**D-14 — MariaDB's "latest 11.x" is now 11.8, and it is also LTS.** The spec's third MariaDB slot assumed a rolling non-LTS release. *Resolution:* offer `10.11` / `11.4` (default) / `11.8`, all LTS, all pinned. Strictly better than tracking a short-lived release.

**D-15 — MySQL 9.x innovation releases are short-lived.** Current is `9.7.2`. Innovation releases are superseded roughly quarterly and unsupported once replaced. *Resolution:* pin `9.7.2`, and document in UPGRADE.md that the 9.x slot is a preview track, not a deployment target; 8.4 LTS stays the default.

**D-16 — pgvector base distro choice.** Unsuffixed `0.8.6-pgNN` tags are Debian 12 **bookworm**; `-trixie` (Debian 13) variants exist. *Resolution:* build on **bookworm** now, because every PGDG extension version in section 4 was verified against `bookworm-pgdg`. A trixie migration is a tracked follow-up, not a phase-2 blocker.

**D-17 — MySQL and MariaDB do not share a base OS.** MySQL official images are **Oracle Linux 9**; MariaDB is **Ubuntu 24.04** (verified: `11.4.12-MariaDB-ubu2404`). Package managers, config paths, and available client tooling differ. *Resolution:* the two Dockerfiles cannot share a tooling layer; `images/mysql/` uses `microdnf`, `images/mariadb/` uses `apt`. Flagged because "baked-in conf.d + client tooling" in section 6 reads as though one recipe covers both. It does not.

**D-18 — `read_only` rootfs conflicts with every engine.** Section 9 asks for read-only root "wherever the engine tolerates it". PostgreSQL needs writable `PGDATA`, `/var/run/postgresql`, and `/tmp`; MySQL/MariaDB need `/var/run/mysqld` and `/tmp`; s6 needs `/run`. *Resolution:* `read_only: true` **with** an explicit tmpfs list per engine, proven by a `make verify` check that boots each engine read-only. If any engine fails that check it gets `read_only: false` with the reason recorded here rather than a silently dropped hardening claim.

**D-19 — Non-root and s6 as PID 1 interact.** s6-overlay must start as root to run its init stages (permissions, cert placement, conf assembly), then drop to the engine user via `s6-setuidgid`. A container-level `USER postgres` would break stage 1. *Resolution:* container runs as root PID 1 (s6), every long-running service drops privileges; `make verify` asserts no engine process runs as uid 0. This satisfies the intent of section 9 while being honest that the *container user* is root.

**D-20 — "No `latest`" vs. the spec's moving tags.** Section 6 lists tags `:9` and `:11`, which are moving aliases. *Resolution:* our published tags keep those friendly aliases, but every **upstream** base is pinned to an exact minor **and digest**; Renovate raises the bumps.

**D-21 — Supply-chain signing.** Section 9 says "signs images with cosign", while the Simtabi org convention settles on `attest-build-provenance` as the mandatory default with cosign optional. *Resolution:* build provenance attestation + syft SBOM are mandatory in CI; cosign is not added in v1 absent a named downstream consumer. Recorded so the SECURITY.md verification instructions match what CI actually produces.

**D-22 — Repo hygiene: `CLAUDE.md` was being silently excluded.** Your global gitignore (`~/.config/git/ignore:22`) ignores `CLAUDE.md`, so the first commit dropped it while committing `.DS_Store`. Since KIT.md makes CLAUDE.md the contract that binds every session and git the memory between them, losing it would quietly break the whole loop. *Resolution:* repo `.gitignore` negates it (`!CLAUDE.md`), which wins over `core.excludesFile`; `.DS_Store` untracked and ignored.

**D-24 — Every script must be bash 3.2 compatible, because macOS ships bash 3.2.** Found in phase 1 when `make lint` died with `mapfile: command not found`. macOS ships GNU bash **3.2.57** (the last GPLv2 release) and this machine has no Homebrew bash, so `mapfile` (bash 4.0), associative arrays (`declare -A`, bash 4.0), and friends are all unavailable. SPEC section 1 promises the toolkit works "identical across macOS, Windows, and Linux", so depending on a bash the platform does not ship would break that promise on the primary development platform — and it would have broken quietly, since CI runs Linux with bash 5. *Resolution:* every script is written to bash 3.2. Array building uses `while IFS= read -r` loops instead of `mapfile`; `check-env`'s port-collision tracking uses a plain string of `port:key` pairs instead of an associative array. A repo `.shellcheckrc` sets `source-path=SCRIPTDIR` so checks can source `lib.sh` through a dynamic path without tripping SC1091. Recorded because it is a standing constraint on every future phase, not a one-off fix.

**D-25 — pgsodium is held at 3.1.9, and no base image would fix it.** pgsodium 3.1.11 fails to compile on our base: `crypto_ipcrypt_NDX_KEYBYTES undeclared`. Its release commit is literally *"Add IP address encryption (crypto_ipcrypt) and bump to libsodium 1.0.2x"* — so 3.1.11 requires libsodium ≥ 1.0.20, while Debian 12 bookworm ships **1.0.18**. I checked whether moving to the trixie base (the D-16 follow-up) would fix it: **Debian 13 trixie ships the same 1.0.18**, so it would not. *Resolution:* pin `PGSODIUM_VERSION=3.1.9`, the last release that builds against 1.0.18, verified by compiling it. The only loss is the brand-new `crypto_ipcrypt` feature, which nothing in SPEC requires. Revisit when either Debian ships libsodium ≥ 1.0.20 or we vendor libsodium.

**D-26 — pg_graphql's .deb ships symlinks that would dangle, and that PG 18 would shadow.** The official package does not put its files in the extension directory: it installs them under `/var/lib/postgresql/extension` and symlinks them from `/usr/share/postgresql/<major>/extension`. Two independent failures follow. First, our builder stage copies only `/usr`, so the links dangle and PostgreSQL reports `Could not open extension control file … No such file or directory` **while `ls` shows the entry present** — a genuinely confusing signature. Second, and worse in production: **PG 18 mounts the data volume at `/var/lib/postgresql` itself**, so even a correct copy would be shadowed by the volume at runtime, and pg_graphql would vanish the moment a user switched majors. *Resolution:* the builder flattens those symlinks into real files and then asserts none remain. Caught by check 09, which is exactly the kind of failure that would otherwise have shipped.

**D-27 — Raising the s6 gracetimes made shutdown worse, not safer.** I set `S6_KILL_GRACETIME` and `S6_SERVICES_GRACETIME` to 30000ms reasoning that a database needs time to stop. Check 10 then failed with a 31s shutdown, and the timestamped log showed why: s6 brought PostgreSQL down cleanly, checkpoint and all, **in about one second** — then sat idle for the remaining 30s before PID 1 exited. The gracetimes do not give a service more time to stop (s6-supervise already waits indefinitely for a longrun to exit); they only govern how long s6 waits *after* everything is already down. *Resolution:* leave both at the s6 default of 3000ms; the database's real budget is `stop_grace_period` / `docker stop -t`. Shutdown went 31s → 4s. Worth recording because the intuitive setting is the harmful one.

**D-28 — Read-only rootfs needed two non-obvious fixes.** SPEC section 9 asks for `read_only` where the engine tolerates it, and D-18 promised an explicit tmpfs list. Two failures had to be fixed to get there, neither of which announces itself clearly:
  - **Docker mounts `--tmpfs` `noexec` by default.** s6 executes `/run/s6/basedir/bin/init`, so the container died at stage 0 with `Permission denied` and exit 126 — a signature that reads like file ownership and is not. `/run` and `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` need `exec`.
  - **The user bundle must live in `/etc/s6-overlay/user-bundles.d`, not `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/user`.** The legacy location makes s6 *write* a `type` file under `/etc` during boot, which a read-only filesystem refuses. s6 had been printing a deprecation warning about exactly this from the first build.
  Generated state (conf, certificates) also moved to `/run/mdb/`, so the writable set is `/run`, `/tmp`, `/var/run/postgresql`, `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, plus the data volume — and nothing under `/etc` or `/usr`.

**D-29 — D-17 was right about the divergence and wrong about what it costs.** I recorded in D-17 that MySQL (Oracle Linux 9) and MariaDB (Ubuntu 24.04) cannot share a tooling layer, and concluded the two images would need separate recipes. Probing them directly showed the divergence is narrower than that: the package manager differs (`microdnf` vs `apt-get`), the client binaries differ (`mysql`/`mysqladmin` vs `mariadb`/`mariadb-admin`), and the missing tools differ (MySQL lacks `procps`/`unzip`, MariaDB lacks `curl`) — but **both include `/etc/mysql/conf.d`, and MariaDB includes it last**, so one generated file dropped there configures either engine and still loses to a user override. *Resolution:* one shared set of init scripts and one shared s6 tree in `images/_shared/mysql-family/`, selected by a `MDB_ENGINE` baked at build time; only the two Dockerfiles differ. This required moving every image's build context from `images/<engine>/` to `images/`, which is why the PG Dockerfile's COPY paths changed too. Recorded because the original entry would have led a later phase to duplicate the whole script set.

**D-30 — The engine descriptor, and why the refactor came before the engines.** Adding MongoDB and Cassandra to a codebase with three hardcoded engines would have meant editing compose, backup, restore, new-project, check-env and a dozen checks per engine — six places to forget one. Engines are now declared in `engines/<name>/engine.conf` and read by generic machinery; family hooks in `engines/_family/<family>.sh` carry the few operations that genuinely need code. Descriptors were written for the three EXISTING engines first, deliberately: if they had not fitted, the abstraction was wrong, and that is far cheaper to learn before two more are built on it. They fitted. See SPEC section 22 and `docs/architecture.md`.

**D-31 — Pooling is a capability, not a service every engine gets.** The request was "connection pooling for all database types". Researching it properly showed a uniform abstraction would be a lie: PostgreSQL *needs* pgBouncer (one OS process per connection, ~10 MB each), MySQL merely benefits from ProxySQL (thread-per-connection is far cheaper), and **MongoDB and Cassandra drivers pool natively** — an external proxy in front of either is an anti-pattern that breaks topology discovery and retryable writes for Mongo, and token-aware routing for Cassandra. The descriptor therefore declares `external` or `driver`, and where it says `driver` the answer is documentation (reuse one client per process), not infrastructure. Check 31 forces every engine to commit to one and explain it.

**D-32 — We publish only OSI-licensed artefacts; MongoDB is referenced, not derived.** My first recommendation was to publish an SSPL-derived MongoDB image with clear labelling, which is what most Docker toolkits do. The better rule: every artefact this project publishes is OSI-licensed, so a downstream user never has to reason about our supply chain. `MDB_ENGINE_PUBLISH=reference` means the upstream image is used directly and configured at runtime — MongoDB stays fully supported, and the licence obligation stays with MongoDB. It generalises: any engine that changes licence moves by flipping one field, with no artefact to withdraw. **FerretDB** was added as the OSI-licensed document alternative (Apache 2.0, MongoDB wire protocol, PostgreSQL storage), with its real gaps recorded in the descriptor rather than discovered later.

**D-33 — MongoDB defaults to 7.0, not the newest, because 8.x cannot start on modern kernels.** MongoDB 8.x refuses to start on Linux kernel 6.19+ ([SERVER-121912](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-121912)). Verified here on kernel 7.0.14: **8.3.7 crash-loops, 7.0.39 runs**. That kernel is not exotic — OrbStack and current distributions ship it — so defaulting to 8.x would have handed a crash loop to a large share of users on first boot. 8.0 and 8.3 remain on the menu.

**D-34 — Both new engines ship insecure, and correcting that is the main value.** MongoDB runs with **no authentication** unless root credentials are supplied. Cassandra ships `AllowAllAuthenticator` **and** `AllowAllAuthorizer` — not weak auth, none, and no authorization either. Worse, merely enabling `PasswordAuthenticator` leaves a superuser named `cassandra` whose password is also `cassandra`: auth that is on with a publicly known credential is barely better than auth that is off. The Cassandra image now flips both settings, refuses to start if it cannot verify them, and rotates that default credential to the generated secret. Check 32 asserts across **every** engine that unauthenticated connections are refused, so a new engine inherits the guarantee by existing.

**D-35 — The pooler stores no application password; it resolves them with `auth_query`.** The obvious pgBouncer setup gives it a userlist of every user and password, making the pooler a second place every credential lives. Instead it has one login role of its own and looks verifiers up through a `SECURITY DEFINER` function, `pgbouncer.get_auth`, which returns a single row and **excludes superusers** — so compromising the pooler yields one credential rather than all of them, and never the superuser's. Its `search_path` is pinned to `pg_catalog`, because a `SECURITY DEFINER` function resolving unqualified names through the caller's path is the CVE-2018-1058 shape. The function is created by a new `mdb-converge` stage that runs on **every** start rather than only at first init, so enabling the pooler on an existing volume does not require destroying the data. Check 33 asserts the behaviour: eight clients collapse onto a pool of two, the userlist contains no application password, and a wrong password is still refused.

**D-36 — Cassandra rate-limits password changes, so provisioning tests the credential instead of resetting it.** The natural idempotent pattern — `CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS ... WITH PASSWORD`, then `ALTER ROLE ... WITH PASSWORD` — fails **every** time on Cassandra, not intermittently: passwords may only be changed once per 5000 ms per role, and the server reports the refusal as `code=1001 [Coordinator node overloaded]`, which names neither the role nor the real cause. The hook therefore only alters a password when it is genuinely wrong, tested by logging in with it, and retries around the limiter when it must. Two other Cassandra-specific traps were found the same way and are recorded in the hook: `cqlsh -e` splits its argument on `;`, so a statement string beginning with a newline produces an empty leading statement and exits non-zero **after** running everything else; and `_cass_set_password` avoids a trailing `[ ] && sleep` list, which returns 1 on its last iteration and trips `set -e` in any caller that has not already neutralised it.

**D-37 — HA is a rehearsal topology, and the profile is the only switch.** Every node runs on one host, so the host is a single point of failure that Patroni cannot fix; what the stack gives you is a genuine election to practise on before you need one. Two design points came out of building it. First, `PROFILES=ha` is the *only* switch: a separate `MDB_HA_ENABLE` flag existed alongside it and gated nothing but a validation, so `PROFILES=ha` with the flag left false ran HA with no quorum check at all. Second, **HA replaces the `pg` profile rather than joining it** — HAProxy owns the PostgreSQL port and routes it to the current leader, so running both binds 5432 twice; `check-env` now compares *effective* ports, defaults included, because a default that collides is still a collision.

**D-38 — Four failures in the Patroni image, each reported as something else.** Worth recording because all four are silent in the same way. (1) The etcd host list written into `patroni.yml` as a comma-separated scalar is a YAML parse error at the first comma: Patroni exits before contacting etcd and the container merely looks unhealthy. (2) Dropping `mdb-postgres` from the s6 bundle is not enough, because s6 starts anything a remaining service *depends* on and `mdb-exporter` depends on it — the upstream entrypoint then ran alongside Patroni against the same data directory and died on a missing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. (3) The data volume must be mounted one level *above* the data directory: Patroni renames that directory when bootstrapping a replica, and a mount point cannot be renamed ("Device or resource busy", while the leader looks fine). (4) `s6-setuidgid` changes the uid but not the environment, so `HOME` stayed `/root`; libpq could not read `/root/.postgresql/`, treated that as a failed TLS start, and **retried unencrypted**, which the `hostssl` replication rule correctly refused — the only visible error named the pg_hba rule.

**D-39 — A failover budget at or below Patroni's `ttl` is unreachable by construction.** The check budgeted 30s against Patroni's default `ttl` of 30s: the leader lock does not expire until the ttl elapses, so no election can *begin* inside the budget however healthy the cluster is. Retuned to `ttl 20 / loop_wait 5 / retry_timeout 5` (Patroni requires `ttl >= loop_wait + 2 × retry_timeout`) with a 60s budget; real failovers now complete in ~20s. Lower is not automatically better — a short ttl makes a brief stall look like a dead leader, and demoting a healthy primary costs more than a few seconds of failover. Relatedly, Patroni will not promote a replica lagging more than `maximum_lag_on_failover`, so **if every replica is behind there is no election at all** and every node logs "I am not the healthiest node". That is correct behaviour, and the check now waits for genuine catch-up before killing the leader rather than reporting it as a broken failover mechanism.

**D-40 — ProxySQL holds password *verifiers*, which is why it could be shipped at all.** I first declined to wire ProxySQL, on the grounds that it has no equivalent of pgBouncer's `auth_query` and would therefore have to store every application password — giving up on MySQL, where pooling is not even necessary, the property D-35 goes to some trouble to preserve. That reasoning was half right and the conclusion was wrong. ProxySQL cannot look a credential up on demand, but what it stores can be the **verifier**: the `caching_sha2_password` hash copied straight out of `mysql.user.authentication_string`, so the pooler knows no more than the server already does. Copied as HEX and reassembled with `UNHEX()` because the value is binary, which is also why configuration goes through the admin interface rather than a `.cnf` — `UNHEX()` is a SQL function and a config file cannot express it. Three supporting decisions: the pooler gets its **own narrow account** (`SELECT` on `mysql.user`, `REPLICATION CLIENT`, nothing else) created by a new MySQL-family convergence stage, because root is restricted to the local socket and that hardening is not worth relaxing; the admin interface on 6032 is **never published**, since it can read every verifier held; and check 35 asserts the stored value carries the `$A$` verifier prefix and does not contain the password, without which this integration would be a security regression over not having it.

**D-41 — Compose profiles are OR, so `pooler` is expanded before compose sees it.** A single shared `pooler` profile starts *every* pooler, including those whose engine was not selected, and compose then rejects the entire project with "service mariadb-pooler depends on undefined service mariadb". Compose has no way to express "pooler AND mysql". Each pooler therefore has its own profile (`pg-pooler`, `mysql-pooler`), and `scripts/profiles` expands `pooler` into the ones matching the selected engines — so the documented `make up PROFILES=pg,pooler` keeps working without compose needing AND semantics.

**D-42 — pgBackRest closes PITR and off-site in one dependency.** The alternative was a hand-rolled `archive_command` copying WAL somewhere, which gets you archiving and nothing else — no retention, no verification that the archive is replayable, no repository format that restore understands. pgBackRest gives WAL archiving, an S3-compatible repository, encryption at rest and `check` from one package. Off by DEFAULT because archiving on a laptop fills a disk with segments nobody will replay; **required** in prod, along with `repo1-type=s3`, because a posix repository lives on the machine it is protecting. The repository gets its own volume, not a directory inside PGDATA, and is not per-major: a backup taken before an upgrade is exactly the one wanted after a failed upgrade. Two failure modes were found building it and are recorded in the code — a convergence stage that exited early on an unrelated missing secret and so silently skipped PITR entirely, and `%%p` in a printf format reaching postgresql.conf as an escaped literal, which handed pgbackrest the two characters `%p` instead of a WAL path and hung the first backup forever.

**D-43 — The vulnerability scanner is a pinned binary, not the trivy action.** In March 2026 an attacker force-pushed 75 of `aquasecurity/trivy-action`'s 76 version tags to steal CI secrets. Referencing it by tag is exactly the supply-chain risk a scanner exists to reduce, so CI downloads the trivy binary at a pinned version and verifies it against the release checksums — the same reasoning that pins every base image by digest, applied to the thing doing the scanning. Scanning fails the build only on HIGH/CRITICAL **with a known fix**: unfixed findings are reported but tolerated, because a scanner that cannot be made green stops being read. Waivers must justify themselves — check 38 rejects a bare CVE ID, a stub reason, or a waiver with no revisit condition, and also fails if CI stops scanning or stops honouring the ignore file, which is the pairing that rots.

**D-44 — An off-site setting that silently does nothing is worse than none.** `MDB_S3_BUCKET` and its credential files were documented in `.env.example` and `push_s3` read none of them: it ran `rclone copy :s3:` with no configuration, failed, and the failure was swallowed by a log line while `backup-all` reported success. That is the worst shape a backup bug can take, because everything looks configured. rclone is now given credentials from the `_FILE` secrets, and a failed push **aborts the backup** rather than being logged. Check 39 asserts the wiring rather than needing an object store: every documented setting is read, credentials are exported, and no tolerated-failure form remains.

**D-45 — Point-in-time recovery targets a binary-log COORDINATE, not a timestamp.** The obvious interface is `--to '2026-08-09 12:00:00'`, and it is quietly broken: `mariadb-binlog` given several files and `--stop-datetime` **exits after the first file and silently skips the rest** ([MDEV-35528](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-35528)). A time-bounded replay therefore recovers almost nothing while reporting success — in testing it emitted 41 lines and no `CREATE DATABASE`, cutting events whose timestamps were demonstrably earlier than the target. Positions have no such bug, no second-granularity ambiguity, and no timezone interpretation, and `--stop-position` applies to the **last file named**, which is exactly the semantics recovery needs: every earlier file replays in full and the final one stops at a byte offset. So `make pitr-restore ENGINE=mariadb TO=binlog.000002:873`, with `make pitr-info` printing the current coordinate and dumps recording theirs. Check 40 proves it end to end.

**D-46 — MySQL claims PITR by extracting one file from a package it cannot install.** The official image is `mysql-community-server-minimal` on Oracle Linux 9 and ships no `mysqlbinlog`, so a binary log could be written and never replayed — an audit trail, not a recovery path. Installing `mysql-community-client` does not work: it also owns `/usr/bin/mysql`, `mysqladmin` and `mysqldump`, and rpm refuses the file conflicts with server-minimal. Six routes were tried before the one that works — the OL9 `mysql` 8.0 client (same conflict), `mysql-community-client` from the enabled repos (absent; the image points at MySQL's *docker* subtree, which carries only server-minimal), MySQL Shell (present, but 8.4.10, and `util.dumpBinlogs`/`loadBinlogs` arrived in Shell 9.2), third-party images carrying the binary (unpullable here), and the generic tarball (no arm64 *minimal* variant). The answer is to fetch the matching client RPM and extract **only** `/usr/bin/mysqlbinlog` from it: no package is installed, nothing conflicts, and nothing else from that package enters the image. Its version is read from the installed server with `rpm -q` rather than pinned, because `mysqlbinlog` must read what this exact server writes and a pinned version would drift silently the first time the base image bumped.

**D-47 — The coordinate statement is spelled three ways, so all three are tried.** MySQL 8.4 **removed** `SHOW MASTER STATUS` in favour of `SHOW BINARY LOG STATUS`; MariaDB added `SHOW BINLOG STATUS` and kept the old name as an alias. Branching on a version string would need updating at every release, so `scripts/pitr` and check 40 try the three in order and use the first that answers. This is the kind of divergence that makes a single-engine check worthless: MariaDB passed on `SHOW MASTER STATUS` while MySQL aborted on it, so check 40 now exercises **both** engines by default.

**D-48 — pgBouncer is built here, not pulled from a third party (supersedes D-10).** D-10 chose `edoburu/pgbouncer` because the vendor's own image is amd64-only and stuck at 1.15.0. That solved the architecture problem and left this toolkit's only community rebuild in the supply chain — an organisation that can be compromised independently of pgBouncer itself, and whose update cadence we do not control, which is the same argument that pins every other reference by digest. `images/pgbouncer/Dockerfile` now builds it from a Docker Official base plus the **PGDG** package, maintained by the PostgreSQL project: current version, both architectures, no third party. The image also carries its own `ENTRYPOINT`, which the replacement initially did not — `docker run` then fell through to the base image's shell and exited 0, a container that "started successfully" having done nothing, and precisely the failure check 33 exists to catch. `IMAGE-PROVENANCE.md` records every image and its publisher, and check 42 fails the build on any namespace that is neither a Docker Official Image nor the upstream project's own.

**D-49 — Publishing a host port is a decision, not a default.** A modest profile set published **ten** host ports, which is ten chances to collide with something already on the machine — and every collision surfaces as a Docker error at the very end of a boot, naming neither the setting nor the process. `MDB_PUBLISH` now takes `none` (the default: publish nothing, applications join the network and use service names, which is what `make new-project` has always printed), `direct` (the old behaviour) or `proxy` (one front door owns the ports). In the latter two, a port is `MDB_PORT_BASE + offset`, so a collision is fixed by moving one number rather than hunting per-engine variables. The offset is **explicit in each descriptor**, not derived from the engine's own port: MongoDB's 27017 plus a 54000 base is 81017, past the end of the port range, and derived offsets would also shift when an engine is added. Check 31 asserts they are unique.

**D-50 — Caddy gets the layer4 module so one front door can serve raw TCP.** Caddy proxies HTTP natively and databases do not speak it, so `proxy` mode needs [caddy-l4](https://github.com/mholt/caddy-l4), built with xcaddy from Caddy's own official builder image — the same shape as the pgBouncer build. Two constraints came out of it. caddy-l4 v0.1.2 requires Caddy **2.11.4** exactly, so both stages moved together; a 2.10.2 builder fails the module graph outright. And the generated routes must sit inside a `layer4 { }` global option — emitted bare, Caddy parses each as a global option and rejects the whole config with *"unrecognized global option: :54004"*, which names the port rather than the missing wrapper. caddy-l4 is pre-1.0 and its author says to expect breaking changes, which is precisely why the default is `none` and `direct` remains: the proxy is a convenience, and nothing here depends on it to function.

**D-23 — Section 19 defaults applied unchanged**, per the kickoff prompt: no plpython3u (toggle available), Tailscale-first prod docs on generic Ubuntu LTS, S3 wiring present but disabled until credentials exist, `ghcr.io/simtabi` private until flipped, defaults PG 17 / MySQL 8.4 / MariaDB 11.4, no extensions beyond sections 5–6, public Laranail conventions only.

## 8. arm64 deliverability

**Nothing in the spec is undeliverable on arm64.** The named unknown anticipated gaps that do not exist:

| Anticipated risk | Actual arm64 status | Workaround needed |
|---|---|---|
| `pg_graphql` (Rust/pgrx) | official prebuilt `.deb`, pg14–18, arm64 | none |
| `pg_net` | source build, portable C | builder stage |
| `pgsodium` | source build, portable C + libsodium | builder stage |
| `pgjwt` | pure plpgsql, arch-independent | vendoring (D-06), not arch |
| `http` | PGDG arm64 1.7.2 | none |
| `pg_partman` | PGDG arm64 5.5.0 | none |
| Every pinned image in §3 | amd64 + arm64 confirmed | none |

The only genuine arm64 hazards found were in **tooling, not extensions**: the official pgBouncer image (amd64-only, D-10) and the backup image's floating tags (arm64-only, D-05). Both are resolved by pinning.

## 9. What happens on approval

Phase 1 builds the complete `make verify` harness first — every SPEC section 18 criterion plus the section 21 additions and the D-09/D-18/D-19 checks — red where features do not exist yet. Then phases 2–7 in order, one per session, each ending on a green `make verify` and a commit.

---

**Awaiting your approval.** The two entries I would most like a decision on before phase 4 are **D-04** (own backup sidecar vs. the 3-job ceiling) and **D-06** (vendor pgjwt vs. drop it). Everything else I consider settled unless you disagree.
