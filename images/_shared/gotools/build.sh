#
# Builds one upstream Go binary from its release tag, on the toolchain this
# stage runs on, for the image's target architecture (DESIGN.md D-51).
#
# The released binaries of gosu, postgres_exporter and rclone are compiled with
# whichever Go was current on their release day, so a Go standard-library CVE
# fixed since then stays in the image until upstream cuts a new release -- gosu
# last released in 2025. Rebuilding the same tag on a patched toolchain removes
# those findings without changing a line of the tool's own code.
#
# Trailing module@version arguments raise a vulnerable dependency to its fixed
# version before building. Each is a floor raised for a named CVE, recorded in
# the Dockerfile beside the call; nothing else in the module graph moves.
#
# Cross-compiled: the stage runs on the BUILD platform and sets GOARCH from
# TARGETARCH, so an arm64 image never compiles under emulation.
