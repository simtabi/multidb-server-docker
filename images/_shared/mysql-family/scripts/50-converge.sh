# Stage 5: cluster-level convergence, applied on EVERY start.
#
# Stage 4 emits into /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d, which the upstream entrypoint
# runs exactly once. That is right for project provisioning and wrong for
# anything a later change may need to introduce -- enabling the pooler on a
# volume created months ago must not require destroying the data.
#
# What it converges is the pooler's own account. ProxySQL cannot use root:
# root is restricted to the local socket, which is correct hardening and
# deliberately not relaxed here. It gets a narrow account instead, the same way
# pgBouncer does on the PostgreSQL side (DESIGN.md D-35):
#
#   * SELECT on mysql.user, to read password VERIFIERS -- never cleartext;
#   * REPLICATION CLIENT, for ProxySQL's monitor module.
#
# Nothing else. A compromised pooler account cannot read application data.
