#
# This is the ONLY credential pgBouncer holds. Application users are resolved
# with auth_query against a narrow SECURITY DEFINER function -- see

# The read above happens as ROOT, and the drop to postgres happens here, at
# exec -- the same read-then-drop the engine entrypoints use, and the reason
# they never hit this: secrets/ is created on the host by make init as the
# invoking user, mode 0700, files 0600. A container process that starts as
# postgres cannot even traverse that directory on Linux, so this script died
# on its very first line with "cannot read" and the check reported "the
# pooler is not running (exit 1)". On macOS the Docker implementation
# flattens ownership, which is why it only ever failed on CI. The image
# previously baked USER postgres, which made the unprivileged read the only
# option; the Dockerfile now leaves the user root and this line is the drop.
