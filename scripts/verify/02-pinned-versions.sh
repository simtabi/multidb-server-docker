# DESIGN.md D-05 is why this check exists rather than being a convention:
# nfrastack/db-backup:latest currently publishes ONLY linux/arm64, so an amd64
# runner following a floating tag fails outright. Pinning prevents it.
#
# Both patterns are anchored to the start of the line, because a Dockerfile
# FROM is an instruction and a compose `image:` is a YAML key -- neither occurs
# mid-line. Allowing anything before them read the SQL in
#     AUTH_QUERY: SELECT username, password FROM pgbouncer.get_auth($1)
# as an unpinned image reference. Anchoring is stricter about WHERE a reference
# may appear, not more permissive about what counts as pinned.
