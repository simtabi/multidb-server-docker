# SPEC section 18: "repo/image-history grep finds no credential".
# Passwords travel by the _FILE convention only, so an assignment with a
# literal value on the right-hand side is a finding by definition.
#
# Two refinements, both learned by this check firing on itself in phase 1:
#
#  1. The key must END with a secret-ish word. DBTK_MYSQL_NATIVE_PASSWORD_COMPAT
#     is a boolean toggle, not a credential, and matching "contains PASSWORD"
#     flagged it.
#
#  2. The harness needs throwaway passwords for containers that live for
#     seconds. Those carry the mandatory `dbtk-throwaway-` prefix, which is
#     exempt HERE ONLY. Deliberately a value convention rather than a path
#     exemption: exempting scripts/verify/ wholesale would create somewhere a
#     real credential could hide, whereas a real credential will never carry
#     this prefix.
