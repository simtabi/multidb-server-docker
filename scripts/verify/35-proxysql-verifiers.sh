# SPEC section 22.4, for the MySQL family.
#
# ProxySQL has no equivalent of pgBouncer's auth_query: it cannot look a
# credential up on demand, it has to hold one. That was the reason this pooler
# was left unwired for a while, and the reason it is wired now is that what it
# holds can be the *verifier* -- the same value the server itself keeps in
# mysql.user.authentication_string -- rather than a cleartext password.
#
# So the assertion is not "the pooler works". It is:
#
#   1. an application user connects THROUGH the pooler;
#   2. what the pooler stores is a verifier, not the password;
#   3. the pooler itself holds no superuser credential;
#   4. a wrong password is still refused.
#
# Without (2) this integration is a security regression over not having it.
