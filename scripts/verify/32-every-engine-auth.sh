# SPEC section 22.3. This is the check that makes "every engine authenticates"
# a property of the toolkit rather than a claim about three of them.
#
# It matters most for the engines added last, because both of them ship
# insecure and correcting that is the main reason to use this toolkit rather
# than the upstream images directly:
#
#   MongoDB    runs with NO authentication unless root credentials are supplied
#   Cassandra  ships AllowAllAuthenticator AND AllowAllAuthorizer
#
# A new engine inherits this check by existing. That is the point: an engine
# with no coverage is an engine nobody can trust, and remembering to add a
# check per engine is exactly the discipline that fails quietly.
