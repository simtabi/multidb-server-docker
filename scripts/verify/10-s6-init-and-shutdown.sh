# This check exists because of DESIGN.md D-09, which is the most dangerous
# integration hazard found in step 1.
#
# The official postgres image sets STOPSIGNAL SIGINT (fast shutdown). s6 sends
# SIGTERM, which PostgreSQL treats as a SMART shutdown: it waits for every
# client to disconnect voluntarily. It therefore hangs until S6_KILL_GRACETIME
# expires, takes a SIGKILL, and forces crash recovery on the next boot -- while
# the container appears to have stopped normally. The fix is a `down-signal`
# file containing SIGINT in the PG service directory.
#
# Nothing about that failure is visible without this check, which is exactly
# why it exists.
