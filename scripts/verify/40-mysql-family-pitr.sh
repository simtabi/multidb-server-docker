# SPEC section 18, criterion 7c, for the MySQL family.
#
# PostgreSQL got PITR through WAL archiving; MySQL and MariaDB had none, so
# their recovery granularity was the last dump. The binary log is the
# equivalent mechanism and the assertion is held to the same standard as
# check 37: recovery to a chosen instant must keep what was written before it
# and drop what came after. "The server restarted" and "a binlog exists" both
# pass on a setup that cannot actually recover.

# Both engines, unless one is named. MySQL's image ships no mysqlbinlog, so the
# Dockerfile extracts that single file from the matching client RPM; without it
# the binary log would be an audit trail rather than a recovery path. Running
# both here is what proves that extraction actually produced a working tool.
# BOTH engines by default. They diverge in three places that each silently
# break recovery -- the coordinate statement's name, the replay tool's name,
# and whether the image ships that tool at all -- so checking one proves
# nothing about the other. MDB_PITR_ENGINE narrows it for debugging.
