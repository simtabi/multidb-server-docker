# SPEC section 18: "PG RLS demo passes".
#
# Check 01 asserts rls/ exists. A directory is not a passing demo, and this is
# the one acceptance criterion where the difference matters most: an RLS setup
# that silently does nothing looks exactly like one that works, right up until
# a tenant reads another tenant's data.
#
# Four assertions, in the order the mistakes are usually made:
#
#   1. a tenant sees only its own rows;
#   2. an UNSET tenant sees nothing -- the policy fails closed, not open;
#   3. a tenant cannot INSERT rows labelled with another tenant's id, which
#      USING alone would permit (writable but invisible, worse than refused);
#   4. the TABLE OWNER is not exempt, which is what FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
#      buys and the single most common way this silently does nothing.
