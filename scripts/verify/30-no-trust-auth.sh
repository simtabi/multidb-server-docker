# SPEC section 9: "no trust/empty-password anywhere, including localhost."
#
# This check exists because the toolkit was violating it. The official
# PostgreSQL image ships an initdb-generated pg_hba.conf that trusts the local
# socket AND loopback TCP:
#
#     local  all  all                   trust
#     host   all  all  127.0.0.1/32     trust
#     host   all  all  ::1/128          trust
#
# The consequence is not theoretical. Any process inside the container -- a
# compromised extension, a sidecar sharing the network namespace, an untrusted
# procedural language -- connects as the superuser with no credential at all.
# It also makes password rotation impossible to verify, because a connection
# over loopback succeeds whatever the password is, which is exactly how this
# was found.
#
# SPEC section 10.1 names the intended local method: peer auth, "reserved for
# make-driven maintenance as the engine user".
