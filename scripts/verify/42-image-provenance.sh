# of the project it packages, and whose update cadence you do not control --
# which is the same argument that pins every reference by digest.
#
# So the allowlist is namespaces, not individual images: a Docker Official
# Image (no namespace at all) or the upstream project's own namespace. Anything
# else has to be justified in IMAGE-PROVENANCE.md, by name.
