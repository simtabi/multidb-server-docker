# What must survive what.
#
# Three different lifetimes get confused with each other, and each confusion
# has a distinct failure:
#
#   * CONFIGURATION is regenerated from .env at every start. It does not need
#     to persist -- it needs to be reproducible, which is stronger. A setting
#     that only exists inside a container is lost on the next rebuild.
#   * DATA lives in named volumes and survives `make down`, a rebuild, and
#     container recreation. Anything in a container's writable layer does not.
#   * RECOVERY DATA -- the pgBackRest repository and the binary logs -- must
#     survive even `make destroy`, because the moment you most want a backup is
#     immediately after destroying something.
