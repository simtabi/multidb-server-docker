#
# new-project used to branch on the engine and supported pg, mysql and mariadb.
# The other three silently fell through to "unknown engine" -- an engine could
# be fully supported everywhere else and have no way to create a project on it,
# and nothing said so.
#
# This asserts the contract, not the implementation: every family defines
# hook_provision_project, every descriptor carries what the printed connection
# block needs, and the hook is idempotent.
