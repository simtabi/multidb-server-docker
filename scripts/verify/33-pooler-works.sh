# SPEC section 22.4. A pooler that starts is not a pooler that works, and the
# failure mode is quiet: connections go to it, it cannot authenticate them, and
# the application falls back to the direct port that is still open in dev. So
# this asserts behaviour, in four parts:
#
#   1. an application user can connect THROUGH the pooler;
#   2. the pooler does not hold that user's password -- it resolves it with
#      auth_query against a narrow SECURITY DEFINER function;
#   3. many client connections collapse onto few server connections, which is
#      the entire point;
#   4. a WRONG password is still refused through the pooler, because a pooler
#      that authenticates everyone is worse than no pooler at all.
