# SPEC section 18, criterion 7c: "PITR active for PG".
#
# The assertion that matters is NOT "pgBackRest is installed" or "a backup
# exists" -- both are true of a setup that cannot actually recover. It is that
# recovery to a chosen instant keeps what was written before it and discards
# what was written after.
#
# So: write row A, record the time, write row B, recover to the recorded time,
# and assert A survived and B did not. A check that only asserted "the database
# came back" would pass on a plain restore of the base backup, which is the
# thing PITR is supposed to improve on.
