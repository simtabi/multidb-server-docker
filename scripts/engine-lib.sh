# The engine descriptor loader (SPEC section 22.1).
#
# Everything generic in the toolkit reads engines through this file. The rule
# that keeps the abstraction real: if something can be expressed in a
# descriptor, it must NOT appear as an `if engine == ...` branch anywhere else.
#
# Usage:
#   source scripts/engine-lib.sh
#   engine_load pg              # populates MDB_ENGINE_* for that engine
#   for e in $(engine_list); do ... done

# Deliberately no `set -e` here: this is sourced by scripts that set their own
# options, and overriding a caller's shell settings from a library is rude.

# Keys every descriptor must declare. A missing one is a descriptor bug, and
# check 31 fails on it rather than letting the gap surface as a confusing
# runtime error three layers away.
