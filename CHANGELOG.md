## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffold per `docs/SPEC.md` section 15.
- The complete `make verify` acceptance harness, written before the features it
  checks so every subsequent phase has something to heal against.
- `DESIGN.md`: pinned versions with digests, the arm64 extension matrix, the
  capacity truth table, and the decision log.
- `docs/SPEC.md` section 21 (scale, HA, sync) as an approved amendment.
- `scripts/check-env`, enforcing sentinel rejection, the `_FILE` convention,
  supported version menus, port-collision detection, and the prod guards
  (mandatory pooling, UI basic auth, 3-node etcd quorum).
- CI workflows for static analysis and the amd64/arm64 verify matrix.

- `db-toolkit-pg`: PostgreSQL 15–18 with the full extension suite (vector,
  PostGIS, pg_cron, pgaudit, pg_repack, pg_partman, pgtap, http, hypopg,
  pg_graphql, pg_net, pgsodium, pgjwt), supervised by s6-overlay v3.
- Ordered s6 init: permissions, configuration, certificates, provisioning, then
  the engine — wrapping the official entrypoint rather than replacing it.
- Multi-project triplet provisioning with cross-project access denied.
- `make init`, `certs`, `build`, `up`, `down`, `status`, `logs`, `psql`.
- `docker-compose.yml` with the `pg` and `ui` profiles and per-major volumes.
- `db-toolkit-mysql` (8.0/8.4/9.7) and `db-toolkit-mariadb` (10.11/11.4/11.8),
  both s6-supervised with baked utf8mb4 / `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` / explicit
  `sql_mode`, triplet provisioning, and the same tool suite.
- phpMyAdmin serving both MySQL-family servers from one instance via
  `PMA_HOSTS`, and `make mysql` / `make mariadb` client shells.

### Fixed

- All shell is bash 3.2 compatible, so the toolkit runs on stock macOS
  (see `DESIGN.md` D-24).
- PostgreSQL now shuts down cleanly under s6 via a per-service `down-signal`,
  so the next boot performs no crash recovery (D-09, D-27).
- `pg_graphql`'s packaged symlinks are flattened, which also protects against
  the PG 18 volume mount shadowing them (D-26).
